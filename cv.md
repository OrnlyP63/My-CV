## Profile 
I have been coding in Python and **working with Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning for five years**. I hold a **bachelor's degree in Mathematics** and a **master's degree in Data Science**. My expertise includes Statistics, Probability Theory, Linear Algebra, Calculus, Partial Differential Equations, and Ordinary Differential Equations, all integrated with Machine Learning applications. I have experience building Machine Learning projects using various frameworks and tools, including NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow, FastAPI, GitHub, and Docker.

My projects primarily focus on improving model training time and reducing resource consumption. I believe that modern Machine Learning needs to be optimized for online streaming data, which demands high computational power and fast training. I have experience writing CUDA C to accelerate model training through parallel processing. Additionally, I research models that require fewer computational resources during the training process. I believe my skills can help you develop Machine Learning solutions that enhance your business.
